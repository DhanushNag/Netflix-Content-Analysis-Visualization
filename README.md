# Netflix-Content-Analysis-Visualization

## üìå Overview
This project uses Netflix's content dataset to perform a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA). The dataset contains metadata about movies and TV shows available on Netflix, including type, country, cast, director, rating, genre, duration, and more.

We explore how content on the platform has evolved over time, which types of shows dominate, and who the most prolific creators and actors are.

- Filled missing values for `country`, `rating`, `cast`, and `director`
- Converted `date_added` to datetime format
- Extracted `year_added` and `month_added`
- Parsed `duration` for movies
- Used string splitting and exploding for genre analysis
